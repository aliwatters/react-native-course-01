# react-native-course-01

Following along with https://www.udemy.com/reactnative - Build Apps with React Native

## Notes
* in the course apps are built on a mac - I'm using linux, and therefore android
* apps in course are built with `react-native init <app name> --version 0.24.0` - used that for weekdays
* useful flex box cheatsheet at: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
* access `console.<blah>` by running `$ react-native log-android`
